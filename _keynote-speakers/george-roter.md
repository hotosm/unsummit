George has had a career of working to support underdog organizations that are imagining what’s possible and good to create in the world. 
</p>
<p>
He is a "pretengineer" -- trained as an engineer, he knows enough about technology to annoy real engineers. He believes that as technologists we are at a pivotal moment, where we must take responsibility for thoughtfully and intentionally ensuring technology is beneficial for all.
</p>
<p>
More prosaically, George recently worked as Director of Open Innovation Programs at Mozilla, leading projects such as Common Voice, which inspired hundreds of thousands of volunteers to contribute their voice to build the world’s largest open voice dataset across more than 50 languages. Prior to that, he was the CEO and co-founder of Engineers Without Borders Canada, a leading innovation, advocacy and talent development NGO.

George has known about HOT for a number of years through his work in international development and open data, but only got involved as a volunteer these past few months, working to support the senior leadership team on the audacious project.

<p>
George is an Ashoka Fellow (2011), was awarded an Action Canada Fellowship (2004) on public policy, and he is humbled to have received four honorary Doctorate degrees.
